TODO: this is a bit of a mess now.  need to think more about how to organize it.

## Data organization

- use a standard scheme if it exists
- everything should be machine readable
- make raw data immutable


## Data structures

- base structures vs data frames


## Data formats and file types


### Metadata

- include provenance


### Data file naming conventions and organization


### Data storage

- files vs database systems
- don't store raw data in the database - link to raw data


### Big data
