# Better Code, Better Science

#### Improving scientific reproducibility using AI-assisted coding


Making science more reproducible and transparent is key to improving public trust in science.  Because science is increasingly a computational enterprise, improving the quality of scientific research code is essential to making science more reproducible. Increasingly, this code is being written with the help of AI assistants, which can increase productivity but introduces the potential for errors.  This book will provide a thorough guide to using AI-assisted coding techniques to generate scientific code that is readable and robust and that can provide reproducible answers to scientific questions.
