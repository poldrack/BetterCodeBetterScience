TODO: this is a bit of a mess now.  need to think more about how to organize it.

## Data organization schemes

- use a standard scheme if it exists
- everything should be machine readable
- make raw data immutable

## Data file naming conventions and organization



## Data formats and file types

## Data structures

- base structures vs data frames

### Why I don't find "long" versus "wide" to be a useful dimension

- tidy data


## Metadata

- include provenance
- ontologies and standards



## Data storage

- files vs database systems
- don't store raw data in the database - link to raw data


## Challenges of big data


## Data documentation

- data dictionaries/codebooks


## Version control for data


## Collaborative workflows

- data shared by multiple researchers
