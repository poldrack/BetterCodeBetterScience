Configure pyproject.toml with all dependencies\n\n  Phase 2: Test Development (TDD)\n\n  - Create comprehensive test suite covering:\n    - Single matrix correlation (self-correlation)\n    - Two matrix cross-correlation\n    - Edge cases (empty matrices, single columns)\n    - GPU acceleration verification\n    - Comparison with standard numpy correlations\n    - Smoke test for main() function\n\n  Phase 3: Core Implementation\n\n  - Implement optcorr function using einsum notation\n  - Handle single vs dual matrix inputs\n  - Ensure proper matrix centering and normalization\n  - Use opt_einsum with PyTorch backend\n\n  Phase 4: GPU Acceleration\n\n  - Auto-detect CUDA or MPS availability\n  - Implement automatic device selection\n  - Handle fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable\n\n  Phase 5: CLI & Entry Point\n\n  - Create main() function for command-line usage\n  - Set up entry point in pyproject.toml\n  - Add basic argument parsing\n\n  Phase 6: Validation\n\n  - Run all tests to ensure functionality\n  - Verify results match standard correlation methods\n  - Test package installation and CLI entry point\n\n  The key technical challenges will be:\n  1. Correctly implementing correlation using einsum notation\n  2. Ensuring numerical stability and accuracy\n  3. Efficient GPU utilization when available\n  4.

There's definitely something wrong if optcorr()\n  is still slow for small matrices when it should be using the numpy\n  backend.

The issue\n  might be that the performance tests are inadvertently using the GPU path.\n   Let me check the notebook logic:\n\n...\n\n The adaptive selection is working perfectly! The small overhead (1.3-2x\n  slower) for small matrices is expected due to:\n\n  1. Function call overhead from the wrapper\n  2. Input validation (type checking, NaN detection, shape validation)\n  3. Reshaping logic for 1D arrays\n  4. Additional checks in _numpy_corrcoef\n\n  This ~1.5-2x overhead is actually quite reasonable for the benefits of\n  having a unified API with automatic optimization. The key insight is that\n   at 3000+ columns, the GPU version becomes 1.78x-5.5x faster than numpy,\n  which is exactly what we want!\n\n  The adaptive backend is working correctly! The \"much slower\" behavior you\n   were seeing before was likely when all matrices were using the GPU path.\n   Now small matrices use numpy (with reasonable overhead) and large\n  matrices use GPU acceleration.","position":{"start":{"line":947,"column":1},"end":{"line":1014,"column":1}},"key":"XFrAmKx366"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":1016,"column":1},"end":{"line":1016,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In

for HPC algorithms\n\nMPS Limitations:\n\n    Limited atomic operation support (289x slower)\n    Unified memory architecture not optimized for irregular access\n    High kernel launch overhead (106x for scattered operations)\n    Different thread execution model\n\nTechnical Analysis\n\nThe reference implementation uses custom CUDA kernels (.cu files) with:\n\n    Direct atomic operations in GPU memory\n    Four specialized kernels: init, merge, compress, final\n    Optimized 2×2×2 block processing\n    CUDA-specific memory access patterns\n\nMy PyTorch implementation attempts to simulate these with Python operations, but:\n\n    Each operation launches separate MPS kernels (massive overhead)\n    No true atomic operations available through PyTorch\n    Memory access patterns don't suit MPS architecture\n\nBottom Line\n\nThis is not an implementation failure - it's an algorithm-hardware mismatch. \nThe BUF algorithm was designed specifically for CUDA's architecture and doesn't \ntranslate to other GPU types.","position":{"start":{"line":1286,"column":1},"end":{"line":1332,"column":1}},"key":"FeVkfyls2n"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":1334,"column":1},"end":{"line":1334,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"This

Let me think about what might \nbe going on here.\n\nFrom the SCRATCHPAD.md, I can see that there was recent work on GPU optimization, \nbut there are some key insights:\n\n1. The performance analysis showed:\n   - GPU GLM computation: 0.4s (brief but intense GPU usage)\n   - GPU voxel correction: <0.01s (vectorized operations) \n   - CPU TFCE correction: 786.7s (98.7% of total time) - CPU-intensive \n    connected components\n   - CPU cluster correction: 9.6s (1.2% of total time) - CPU-based \n    scipy operations\n\n2. The issue is that TFCE and cluster corrections are CPU-dominated because \nthey require connected components analysis which can't easily be done on GPU.\n\nBut with 2500 permutations, this should be much more pronounced. Let me think \nabout what might be happening:\n\n1. **The bulk of the work is happening on CPU**: TFCE and cluster corrections \nrequire connected components labeling, which uses scipy.ndimage and can't be easily \nGPU-accelerated. With 2500 permutations, this would be \n2500 * (TFCE processing time + cluster processing time) on CPU.\n\n2. **GPU work is actually minimal**: The actual GLM computation might be a small \nfraction of the total work. Even with GPU optimization, if you're running TFCE \nand cluster corrections, most of the processing time will be spent on CPU doing \nconnected components analysis.\n\n3. **Streaming vs Traditional corrections**: The user is running multiple correction \ntypes. I need to understand how the streaming corrections work and whether they're \nactually being used effectively.\n\n4. **Batch processing**: With 2500 permutations, there should be opportunities for \nbetter batching and parallelization.\n \nThe computational bottleneck stems from spatial connectivity methods. With multiple \ncorrection approaches, the TFCE and cluster corrections dominate processing time. \nVoxel-wise corrections benefit from GPU acceleration, but the complex spatial analysis \nof TFCE and cluster methods remain CPU-intensive. The high permutation count (2500) \nexponentially increases the CPU workload, making GPU optimization less impactful \nacross the entire analysis pipeline.\n\nI'll explore the backend implementation, focusing on performance bottlenecks and \npotential GPU optimization strategies. Key areas include streaming correction efficiency \nand computational resource allocation.\n\n🤖 Assistant\n\nYou're absolutely right - let me investigate this more deeply. With 2500 permutations \nand multiple correction methods, there should be significant opportunities for GPU utilization. \nLet me examine the current implementation to understand what's really happening.","position":{"start":{"line":1430,"column":1},"end":{"line":1493,"column":1}},"key":"WAil0lXri0"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":1495,"column":1},"end":{"line":1496,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Be judicious in asking for extra thinking, since it can greatly slow down the work of the model.\nBut in cases when it’s necessary it can be very effective.","position":{"start":{"line":1495,"column":1},"end":{"line":1495,"column":1}},"key":"QiSVJpvBUG"}],"key":"YAZmYDVmHN"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":1498,"column":1},"end":{"line":1498,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tracking problems during agentic coding","position":{"start":{"line":1498,"column":1},"end":{"line":1498,"column":1}},"key":"MJEV9XEUNw"}],"identifier":"tracking-problems-during-agentic-coding","label":"Tracking problems during agentic coding","html_id":"tracking-problems-during-agentic-coding","implicit":true,"key":"YMorgB0gTn"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":1500,"column":1},"end":{"line":1500,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I find that when I’m working with a coding agent like Claude Code, it will often make changes that raise more than one issue that needs to be subsequently fixed.
