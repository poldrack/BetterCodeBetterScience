Above all else, using a consistent organizational scheme makes development easier because it allows one to rely upon defaults rather than making decisions, and to rely upon assumptions rather than asking questions. In this chapter we will talk about various aspects of project organization and management. We will discuss the use of computational notebooks and ways to make them more amenable to a reproducible computational workflow, as well as when and how to move beyond notebooks.  We will then discuss file and folder organization within a project.

Remember the Agile software development idea that we discussed in Chapter 1, which stresses the importance of “working software” over clean, well-documented code. This is not to say that we don’t want clean, well-documented code in the end; rather, it implies that we should first get something working that solves our problem (the “minimum viable product”), and once we have that we can then clean up, refactor, and document the code to help address the next goals.

However, all variables are global in a notebook, unless they are contained within a function or class defined within the notebook.  However, the global scope of variables in the notebook means that if there is a variable used within a function with the same name as a variable in the global namespace, that variable can be accessed within the function.  I have on more than one occasion seen tricky bugs occur when the user creates a function to encapsulate some code, but then forgets to define a variable within the function that exists in the global state.  This leads to the operation of the function changing depending on the value of the global variable, in a way that can be incredibly confusing.
