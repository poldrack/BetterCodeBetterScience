experience.\nIt is also free and open source, which means that anyone with a computer can download it and run it at no cost.\nIn addition, Python is a language that has exceptionally good support from AI coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, which has been trained on a huge corpus of Python code (along with code from many other languages as well).\nPython also has a large and growing ecosystem of packages and tools that make it possible to solve many different problems easily.\nIf you are interested in working on machine learning or AI, the tools in Python are especially

three separate commits.\nThis is too granular; if we later decide that we want to roll back those changes (which could be difficult depending on commit messages and our memory), we have to identify the three separate commits and then roll back each one separately.\nAt the other extreme, it’s not uncommon for users to check in all of the work that was done in a day, with a commit message like “all work from Tuesday”.\nIf one were to later decide that part of the work from that day needed to be rolled back, it would require a lot of extra work to isolate just those changes.\nThe sweet spot for committing is to commit changes that represent a functional bundle, or that solve a particular problem.\nThinking about the commit message can be helpful in considering when to commit; if it’s difficult to give a concise functional description to the specific set of changes being committed, then the commit may be either too narrow or too

developer has a codebase and wants to try out a major change, such as changing the database backend used in the project.\nThey would usually save a copy of all of the source files (perhaps with a timestamped label), and then start working on the problem.\nIf at some point they wish to completely abandon the new project, they can always go back to the copy of the original.\nBut what if they want to abandon the latest part (e.g. a specific database) without necessarily abandoning the rest of the work that it took to get there? Unless they are saving copies at every step (which quickly becomes a bookkeeping nightmare), this will be very challenging to pull off.\nOn the other hand, with a solid version control workflow these

those package versions are available on the users’s operating system).\nThis can greatly enhance the reproducibility of computational analyses across systems, and can also ease the implementation of
